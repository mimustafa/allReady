## <a name='Overview'></a> Overview

This documentation will advise how to create a task for an event within a campaign in the allReady application.

## <a name='Prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

The user must have already created a campaign, and within that campaign, created a specific event (for which the task can be added to).

The user should be an administrator within the allReady application in order to see this option.

First, a user signs in to the allReady application with an administrator account.
Within Admin options, the user will select Campaigns.
