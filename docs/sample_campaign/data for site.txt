Spreading the word about the local risks of flooding

Be Water Wise, Get Out In Time

We live in an area where over 10,000 residents live in the flood plain and are at risk of being in the way of flood waters. Flooding can cause property and vehicle damage, put life at risk and put a strain on critical emergency services that could be used elsewhere. 

Help us spread the word about being prepared, having a plan and getting out of the way of the floods safely.
